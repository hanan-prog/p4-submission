                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    I have an Entity class that represents all the objects in the scene, and a GameMap class that reads
                    the scene file and creates all the entities. The game map contains the main logic of the program;
                    it's responsible for applying transformations to all the entities in the scene before redrawing. I handle collisions by
                    checking if the new position we want to move to plus some number and seeing if that new position
                    will cause a collision. if it does, I don't update the cameras position. You can download a copy of the code <a href="p4.zip">here</a>
                    You pick up the key by pressing the enter button and if you are sufficently close enough you'll be able to pick up the key. I implemented different textures for the different models, wood for the floors and brick walls.
