                    I have an Entity class that represents all the objects in the scene, and a GameMap class that reads
                    the scene file and creates all the entities. The game map contains the main logic of the program;
                    it's responsible for applying transformations to all the entities in the scene before redrawing. I handle collisions by
                    checking if the new position we want to move to plus some number and seeing if that new position
                    will cause a collision. if it does, I don't update the cameras position. You can download a copy of the code <a href="p4.zip">here</a>
